# Project-Template

## Intention

> This project is a template for side projects.
> It's designed to use each part separate or as one application. 
> It should be possible to just use the PHP Backend or
> the Vue Frontend or both together.
> If you don't want to use one of the parts just leave it there or
> delete it.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/51imyy/project-template.git
$ rm -rf .git
```
> Scripts are defined in the composer.json and are callable via 
> ```shell
> $ composer my_script
> ```

> now you are ready to go.
